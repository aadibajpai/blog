*June 2020 (and probably final) edit:* Google Code-in has now been discontinued. 

As much as I'd like to say my disappointment is immeasurable and my day has been ruined, I'm just grateful for the amazing people I got to meet and the fun stuff I got to do directly or indirectly through the program. If you're reading this in expectation of GCI, I wish you luck in your endeavours :)

Ultimately, here is a testimonial from Dylan Iskandar, GCI GPW 2019:

If you read this in time for [Code-in](http://g.co/gci) 2019 and are aged between 13 to 17, you might be in luck, for this post might just help you out. It would’ve made it easier for me too, if this existed before I won. I list some pro tips that I feel would be useful in order to fully experience GCI.

The aim of the contest is to simply encourage young developers to get started with open-source. Interestingly, unlike other contests, not everyone participates in GCI to truly win. Yes, I hear you, the Grand Prize is an all expenses paid 4 days trip to fucking Googleplex and here you see me saying some people don’t really concentrate on that. It is true though, a participant can approach Code-in two ways-

1. Quickly complete 3 noob tasks (including 2 beginner tasks) which guarantees you a Google Code-in t-shirt and call it quits. It’s that simple, you could do that in just a day.

1. Work constantly through the 7 weeks and go all in hoping for the big prize.

Unsurprisingly, most people go with the first option. Google Code-in 2017 had 3555 students who completed 16468 tasks. That averages to a bit over 4 tasks per student. (I did 21 - and that’s just the tasks I could claim)
