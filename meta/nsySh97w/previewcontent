Last week was [VandyHacks VII](https://vandyhacks.org), Vanderbilt's cool annual hackathon. It was awesome, I had a great time with great people. I was the only Fall recruit to the VandyHacks board, and I knew I had to underpromise and overdeliver. Thus was born the squirrel from VandyHacks. I wanted to chronicle a part of it for posterity, so here we are, approximately a month and 1250 words later.

## What is the squirrel from VandyHacks?

"the squirrel from VandyHacks" is a very special Discord bot created for VandyHacks VII with a slew of commands ~~and easter eggs~~ to enhance hacker engagement and provide key hackathon info right on Discord. Without delving too much into all that, the important idea is that I baked in a `vh quest` command that essentially activated an 8 challenge long mini CTF. Why this was a good idea, I'm not sure but it got a good response so yay. 

If you're curious about the bot, look at it at https://github.com/VandyHacks/the-squirrel-from-VandyHacks.

Hereâ€™s like the top three most used commands in the hackathon Discord server, just so there is a record (I also wanted to use a markdown table). I think the schedule command especially was way more popular than I expected.

| command     | uses |
| ----------- | ---- |
| vh pat      | 1391 |
| vh schedule | 249  |
| vh when     | 145  |

## Quest challenges

The challenges, the flags and some of the motivation behind each of them. 

### Level 0

> welcome to vh quest! this is a ctf-style, fun treasure hunt where you look for flags like `vh{yes_this_is_a_flag_hehe}` hidden in places with cryptic clues to advance to the next level. Flags are always in the vh{} format. Feel free to reach out for hints and good luck on your quest! <:vh_heart:>
