## Hello
I'm not going to write anymore on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@aadibajpai) (too much pay to play), and this is where new posts will be published.

I love this blog, although it is a relative pain to maintain, purely because of this retro vibe it has going on.

It is pretty formal as well, which is how I imagine myself writing (all hunched over a typewriter by candlelight lol).

The source code of this blog is at https://github.com/aadibajpai/blog. It is composed solely of linux utilities and I am a Windows pleb unfortunately. This meant configuring a lot of stuff to work with wsl and figuring out how to run the Windows Sublime Text program from inside wsl to create and edit posts like this one. Previously, I used to actually ssh into a linux server just to run the blog, that's how much I like it. 

This also serves as a test blog post.

Lorem Ipsum or whatever.

`import __hello__  # This should be inline code`

```
from __future__ import braces
import antigravity
# A few Python easter eggs and also an example of a code block
```

*italics* and **bold**

Thanks for visiting, stay to read a couple of posts :)
