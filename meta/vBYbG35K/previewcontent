It has been a while since I wrote something and I wanted to remedy that. I figured 
I could write more and less, as in more posts but shorter in length and content.
To that end, writing about my past semester academically while it is mostly fresh in my mind seemed to 
be a good idea, I had planned to write something for my spring semester along the lines of what classes I took, 
how I did, what I thought of them and so on but it never ended up happening. I also think writing about classes 
and such is good because it's not that interesting to read about college classes but easy to write on since it's 
just my experience.

This semester I took 17 hours worth of classes:

- Linear Algebra (math 2410)
- Multivariable Calculus (math 2300)
- Intro to Microeconomics (econ 1020)
- Digital Systems (w/ lab) (eece 2123)
- Theory of Automata (cs 3252)
- CS Senior Seminar (cs 4959)

I am not going to talk about them in an organized manner with nice subheadings because that doesn't seem fun, I will talk about them in order though. There isn't much to say about some of them but for the others I could talk a fair bit. Let us start.
