I'm actually just going to write a writeup for Luna, because that's the one I found the most interesting.

# Luna
> They say the full moon makes people go crazy... hopefully this stego won't have the same effect on you!

So as you see, you start off with a `tar.xz` file which on unzipping gives a `Luna.tar` file which on further unzipping gives a file named `1.png` and a zipped folder with two password protected filesâ€”`Just In Case.png` and `jut`.

Clearly, we're supposed to start out with `1.png` which in looks is nothing but an all white image.

I ran the [stegoveritas](https://github.com/bannsec/stegoVeritas) tool on it to examine it further and it gave a lot of metadata and exif info and carved out a couple of `.zlib` files. Interestingly, the metadata had 2 fields that stood out: 

1. `StudyPhysician: awcIsALegendAndIHopeThisIsAStrongPasswordJackTheRipperBegone`
2. `Description: oops, all #FFD2A4#`

From the first, we have our password! The `jut` file seemed absolute gibberish while `Just In Case.png` was a screenshot from gimp.

Looking at `jut` from a hex editor, the first 3 characters were interesting: `BPS`

A `.bps` file is one used to patch ROMs on like SNES emulators and stuff so I downloaded [Flips](https://github.com/Alcaro/Flips), a patcher for BPS files. 

I tried to patch `jut` on `1.png` but welp, no dice.

Circling back, we hadn't yet used the 2nd line from metadata nor `Just In Case.png` so it has to do something with those.

"oops, all #FFD2A4#" seems to imply that the image shouldn't be all white but that hex color, and `Just In Case.png` has specific export instructions. So I ssh into a linux server with x11 to use gimp (yes, I am a windows pleb) and when that was too slow I just ask a friend on Linux. After those operations, our new `1.png` looks like this:

Now we patch `jut` on top of this and voila!

Honestly, this was a pretty involved challenge and Justin really did a great job with this, so props for that. I would even recommend his other challenge, Remy's Epic Adventure 2: Electric Boogaloo but I'm gonna procrastinate on writing that writeup lol.
