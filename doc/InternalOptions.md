In addition to the options listed publicly, the following options exist for
internal use only. __Setting them yourself will either be terribly bad or just
be ignored by BM__. Do __not__ set these.

# `post_file_name`

This internal option no longer exists as of BM `v4.2.1-dev (f735686)`. It
stopped existing before then, but I'm too lazy to comb the git history to
figure out exactly when. It might have been v3.0.0, but don't count on it.

~~The original file name for the post we are working on and these options belong
to. This was a lifesaver when we were mucking around in a sea of temporary
files, which doesn't really describe BM after the v3.0.0 release.  It will
continue getting set into the v3.0.0 series and for the foreseeable future,
though it may not actually get used.~~
